# Deep 3D morphable model refinement via progressive growing of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks

This page contains end-to-end demo code to recover accurate and detailed reconstructions of the facial shape from an unconstrained 2D face image. For a given input image, it fits a 3D Morphable Face Model [2] to the face image and then uses a CGAN to refine the reconstruction by adding local fine-grained details. The code outputs a standard obj file (without texture). The full approach is described in our paper [1].

## Library Requirements

* cmake
* dlib
* face-alignment
* opencv-python
* scipy==1.1.0
* scikit-image
* tensorflow

Dependencies can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Requirements

Use the following link to download the [3DMM data](https://drive.google.com/a/unifi.it/file/d/12ull7YHxsqEvF4OlllOc8kneS9h4fI7y/view?usp=sharing) and the [CGAN weights](https://drive.google.com/a/unifi.it/file/d/1FaGyOygkYbL8UpUYgAv2Hh7h-KergaDl/view?usp=sharing).

The *data3dmm* folder and the *.pb* file must be placed in the root folder.

## Usage

The script can be run with the following: `python main.py < --im_path imgname > < --use_camera >`

If `--im_path` is not specified, the default image is used. Test images must be placed into *testdata* folder. 

If a webcam is available, `--use_camera` can be used to capture a live frame.
